# Class01 
### several key topics that are essential for beginners. Understanding the syntax of the language, identifying and fixing errors, and knowing the difference between mutable and immutable objects are all important concepts that can help you become a better Python programmer. Additionally, learning about Big O provides a foundation for analyzing and optimizing the efficiency of your algorithms.
 
## Pain and Suffering main challenges faced by beginners when learning Python 

1.	Syntax: Beginners may find it difficult to understand the syntax because there is different active languages. 
Strategies:
Practice more and consistently Seek help, keep focus in the differences between languages. 

2.	Errors: beginners may struggle with identifying and fixing errors in their code. 
Strategies:
Search more for the errors and learn for it to avoid it again. 


## Beginners guide to Big O
We measure algorithm performance using time complexity and spatial complexity.
Time complexity is the length of time it takes for an algorithm to finish is known as its temporal complexity.

Space complexity is a measure of how much memory an algorithm consumes.

## Names and values in python 
| Mutable                                             | Immutable                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The objects can be modified after the creation as well. | Objects cannot be modified after the creation of the objects.     |
| Classes that are mutable are not considered final.    | Classes that are immutable are considered final.                 |
| Classes are not made final for the mutable objects.   | Classes are made final for the immutable objects.                |
| Example: Lists, Dicts, Sets, User-Defined Classes, Dictionaries, etc. | Example: int, float, bool, string, Unicode, tuple, Numbers, etc. |
