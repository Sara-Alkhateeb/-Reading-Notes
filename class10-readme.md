## 1: Q: What is a stack?

A: A stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure used in computer programming. It allows for the storage and retrieval of data, where the last item added to the stack is the first item to be removed from it.
## 2: Q: What are the operations that can be performed on a stack?

A: The operations that can be performed on a stack are: Push (adds an item to the top of the stack), Pop (removes the top item from the stack), Peek (returns the top item from the stack without removing it), and isEmpty (checks if the stack is empty).
## 3: Q: What are some applications of stacks?

A: Stacks are used in a variety of applications, such as parsing expressions, implementing recursive algorithms, and undo/redo functionality.
## 4: Q: What is a queue?

A: A queue is a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure used in computer programming. It allows for the storage and retrieval of data, where the first item added to the queue is the first item to be removed from it.
## 5: Q: What are the operations that can be performed on a queue?

A: The operations that can be performed on a queue are: Enqueue (adds an item to the back of the queue), Dequeue (removes the front item from the queue), Peek (returns the front item from the queue without removing it), and isEmpty (checks if the queue is empty).
## 6: Q: What are some applications of queues?

A: Queues are used in a variety of applications, such as process scheduling, job queues, and breadth-first search algorithms.
## 7: Q: How can stacks and queues be implemented?

A: Both stacks and queues can be implemented using arrays or linked lists. In an array implementation, the size of the stack or queue is fixed, while in a linked list implementation, the size can be dynamic.
