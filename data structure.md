# Data Structures and Algorithms
## Overview
    Studying Python data structures and algorithms is beneficial since it boosts problem-solving abilities, optimizes software efficiency, and is highly sought after in technical interviews. Python's clear syntax also makes code simple to read, and the language's extensive library of data structures and algorithms may improve your programming skills.

## What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?
    Using data structure for solving problem, it's crucial to take the needs of the problem into consideration as well as the qualities of your data. The effectiveness and scalability of your solution can be greatly enhanced by an efficient data structure.


    Time complexity refers to the amount of time it takes for an algorithm to execute, while space complexity refers to the amount of memory required to store data.

## How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?
1. To prevent infinite recursion, it's important to define a base case that stops the recursive calls. A base case is a condition that, when reached, terminates the recursion.
2. You can avoid infinite recursion by limiting the number of recursive calls that your function can make. This involves setting a maximum number of calls that the function can perform before it returns a value and stops calling itself.
