## What is React Context, and how does it help in managing state and data sharing in a React application?
React Context is a feature in React that enables efficient sharing of data and state between components without the need for passing props down the component tree (prop drilling). It uses a provider-consumer pattern, allowing components to access global data through a provider and Context.Provider. This approach optimizes re-renders and supports dynamic changes to the shared data. While helpful for themes, authentication, and settings, it's best used alongside proper state management solutions like Redux for more complex applications.

## Explain the useContext Hook and how it can be used to access data from a React Context within a functional component.


The useContext hook in React allows functional components to access shared data from a React Context without the need for a separate consumer component. It simplifies data retrieval, making code concise and readable. To use it, create a Context with createContext, provide it using Provider, and consume data with useContext inside functional components within the Context's scope.

## Describe the purpose of Next.js, and provide an example from the Vercel Next.js Examples reading on how it can be used to build a scalable web application.

Next.js is a React framework that simplifies web application development by supporting server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and client-side rendering (CSR). It offers automatic routing, code splitting, and built-in CSS-in-JS support. An example from the Vercel Next.js Examples repository demonstrates how to build a scalable web app with authentication using Auth0. This example showcases secure login, protected routes, and session management, highlighting Next.js's capabilities for creating robust applications with a seamless authentication experience.
