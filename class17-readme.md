## What are the key differences between scraping static and dynamic websites?
> Page Structure: Static websites have fixed content that doesn't change unless someone manually updates it. Dynamic websites, however, use special code to create content that can change based on what users do or what the server sends back. This means that the structure of a dynamic website can change while you're using it.

> Content Rendering: Static websites show their content right away when you open them. So if you want to scrape information from a static website, you can easily do it. But dynamic websites need special code called JavaScript to show their content. When you want to scrape a dynamic website, you have to make sure the JavaScript is run and then capture the content that appears.

> Data Accessibility: Static websites usually have all the data you need right there in the code of the page. It's like having everything out in the open. But with dynamic websites, the data might come from other places or services after the page has already loaded. To scrape data from dynamic websites, you might have to look at the requests the website makes to get that data and capture it.

> Interactivity: Dynamic websites often have things you can click on, forms you can fill out, or content that keeps loading as you scroll. To scrape these websites, you have to pretend to be a user and interact with the website like clicking buttons, filling forms, or scrolling to make sure you get all the information you want.

>Scraping Techniques: For static websites, you can use special tools or code libraries that make it easy to scrape and get the information you need. But dynamic websites require more advanced techniques. You might need to use special tools that act like web browsers, running the JavaScript and capturing the full content of the page to scrape it.

> Performance and Complexity: Scraping dynamic websites is usually harder and more complicated than scraping static websites. It requires more resources and expertise because you have to deal with things like running JavaScript code, handling requests that happen in the background, and imitating user actions. These things can make scraping dynamic websites more challenging.

## Explain at least three techniques or best practices that can be employed to avoid getting blocked while scraping websites.
1. Follow the Website's Rules: Websites often have a file called "robots.txt" that tells scrapers which parts of the site they can access. It's important to read and respect this file. If a website specifies that certain pages should not be scraped, it's best to honor that and avoid scraping those restricted areas. Respecting the website's rules helps maintain a good relationship and reduces the risk of being blocked.

2. Scrape Responsibly: Scraping too quickly or aggressively can raise red flags and lead to blocking. To avoid this, adjust your scraping speed to be more like a human browsing the website. Add delays between your requests to make it seem more natural. By not overwhelming the website's server, you reduce the chances of being detected and blocked. It's also important to be mindful of any rate limits or restrictions set by the website.

3. Use Proxies and Rotate IP Addresses: Proxies act as intermediaries between your scraping code and the website. They allow you to make requests from different IP addresses, making it harder for the website to track and block your activity. By rotating IP addresses or using different proxies, you can distribute your requests and avoid being identified based on a single IP. This helps protect your scraping activities and reduces the risk of being blocked.

## What is Playwright, and how does it assist in web scraping tasks? Provide an example of a use case where Playwright would be particularly beneficial.
> Playwright is a tool that helps automate and control web browsers. It allows you to interact with web pages, execute JavaScript, and retrieve data. Playwright can be beneficial in web scraping tasks because it provides a simple and powerful way to scrape dynamic websites that rely heavily on JavaScript for content rendering.

## This is how Playwright assists in web scraping:

Emulating User Interaction: Playwright enables you to automate browser actions like clicking buttons, filling out forms, scrolling, and navigating between pages. This means you can mimic human interaction with the website, which is particularly useful for scraping dynamic websites with interactive elements.

JavaScript Execution: Playwright can execute JavaScript code within the context of a web page. Dynamic websites often use JavaScript to generate or modify their content. By running JavaScript using Playwright, you can access and extract data that may not be directly visible in the page source code.

Capturing Rendered HTML: Playwright allows you to capture the fully rendered HTML of a web page after JavaScript execution. This is crucial for scraping dynamic websites because the content is often generated dynamically. By retrieving the rendered HTML, you can extract the data you need accurately.

## A use case where Playwright would be particularly beneficial is scraping an e-commerce website that dynamically loads product listings as the user scrolls down. 
1. Emulating Scrolling: With Playwright, you can automate the scrolling action on the website, making it load more products. This way, you can ensure you capture all the available product data without manually scrolling through the entire page.

2. JavaScript Execution: Playwright executes the JavaScript code responsible for fetching and displaying additional product listings. By letting Playwright handle the JavaScript execution, you can obtain the full set of product data, including the dynamically loaded content.

3. Extracting Data: Playwright allows you to extract specific information from the rendered HTML, such as product names, prices, descriptions, and images. By navigating through the pages and interacting with the website using Playwright, you can scrape the desired data accurately and efficiently.
