## Django Rest Framework (DRF) 
### permissions play a vital role in securing an API. They control access to API resources based on user authentication and authorization. DRF permissions consist of three key components: authentication, authorization, and permissions.

## Authentication 
### involves identifying the user making the request. DRF offers various authentication classes like token authentication, session authentication, and OAuth authentication, which verify the user's identity and allow access to the authenticated user in views or serializers. also determines whether an authenticated user has the necessary permissions for a specific action on a resource. DRF provides different authorization classes such as IsAuthenticated, IsAdminUser, AllowAny, and DjangoModelPermissions, defining permission requirements for API views or actions.

## Permissions 
### in DRF are rules that define whether a user is allowed to perform certain actions on a resource. DRF offers permission classes like IsAuthenticated, IsAdminUser, AllowAny, IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly, and DjangoModelPermissions, allowing you to define access control based on user roles or object-level permissions.

## The purpose
### of DRF permissions is to ensure that only authenticated and authorized users can access and modify API resources. Authentication verifies the user's identity, authorization sets permission requirements for actions, and permissions fine-tune access control based on specific criteria.

### In SQL, the SELECT statement retrieves data from a database table. It is used to query the database and fetch specific columns or expressions from one or more tables based on specified conditions.


### DRF Generic Views are pre-built views provided by DRF to simplify building RESTful APIs. They abstract common patterns and behaviors, reducing code and promoting reusability. DRF Generic Views handle common CRUD operations (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) for resources in a standardized manner.

## Here are a few examples of using DRF Generic Views in building a RESTful API:

        ListAPIView: Retrieves a list of resources using the HTTP GET method. It fetches objects from a database and serializes them as a list.

        RetrieveAPIView: Retrieves a single resource using the HTTP GET method with a specific identifier. It retrieves a single object based on its unique identifier.

        CreateAPIView: Creates a new resource using the HTTP POST method. It creates a new object based on the request data.

        UpdateAPIView: Updates an existing resource using the HTTP PUT or PATCH methods with a specific identifier. It updates an object based on its unique identifier and the data provided in the request.
