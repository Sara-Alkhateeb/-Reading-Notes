## trees
Root: The root of a tree is the topmost node in the tree. It is the starting point and has no parent.

Node: Nodes are elements or entities within a tree. Each node contains data and can have child nodes connected to it.

Edge: Edges represent the connections between nodes in a tree. They define the relationships and structure of the tree.

Parent and Child: In a tree, a node that has a direct connection to another node is called the parent, and the connected node is referred to as the child.

Leaf: A leaf node, also known as a terminal node, is a node that has no children. It is located at the end of a branch.

Depth and Height: The depth of a node is the number of edges from the root to that node. The height of a node is the number of edges in the longest path from that node to a leaf. The height of a tree is the height of the root node.

Binary Trees: Binary Trees are trees where each node can have at most two children, commonly referred to as the left child and the right child.

Binary Search Trees (BST): BSTs are binary trees that follow a specific ordering property. For any node, all values in its left subtree are less than the node's value, and all values in its right subtree are greater.

Balanced Trees: Balanced trees are trees that maintain a balance between the left and right subtrees, ensuring efficient operations. Examples include AVL Trees and Red-Black Trees.

Tree Traversal: Tree traversal refers to the process of visiting nodes in a tree in a specific order. Common traversal methods are pre-order, in-order, and post-order.

Tree Applications: Trees are used in various applications, such as organizing hierarchical data, representing file systems, implementing search algorithms, decision-making processes, and more.
