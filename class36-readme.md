## From the “6 tips to ace a whiteboard programming interview” article, can you identify and explain at least two strategies that can help improve your performance during a whiteboard programming interview?

        Talk through your thought process: Verbalize your thinking as you solve the problem on the whiteboard. This helps the interviewer understand your approach, demonstrates your problem-solving abilities, and keeps you focused and organized.

        Test your code and consider edge cases: Thoroughly test your code with sample inputs, including edge cases. This allows you to identify bugs or logical errors, showcases your attention to detail, and demonstrates your ability to handle different scenarios.

## What does Gayle McDowell say about interview preparation in the Engineering Interview Process Deconstructed video?
        Interview Focus: Gayle emphasizes that technical interviews should primarily assess a candidate's problem-solving abilities and intelligence. The goal is to gauge their potential as a competent employee, rather than simply reflecting their current level of expertise.

        Interview Questions: Gayle advocates for challenging interview questions that revolve around problem-solving. She discourages the use of obscure knowledge or trick questions and emphasizes the importance of evaluating a candidate's aptitude for tackling difficult problems.

        Interview Preparation: Gayle suggests that candidates dedicate a few weeks to prepare for interviews. She highlights the significance of gaining proficiency in fundamental data structures and algorithms. Even candidates without formal computer science degrees or from bootcamps can boost their confidence in problem-solving skills through focused preparation.

        Making Hiring Decisions: Gayle recommends that companies prioritize a candidate's overall attributes instead of seeking unanimous agreement from all interviewers. Each interviewer should assess candidates based on specific attributes they are evaluating, leading to a fairer and more balanced hiring decision-making process.
