# Class16- Serverless Functions
## 1. What are the key characteristics of serverless computing, and how does it differ from traditional server-based architectures?
No Server Management: Developers are relieved from managing and provisioning servers as the cloud provider handles the underlying infrastructure.

Event-driven Execution: Serverless functions are triggered by specific events or requests, ensuring efficient resource utilization.

Automatic Scaling: Serverless platforms scale functions automatically based on workload, eliminating the need for manual intervention.

Pay-per-Use Billing: Billing is based on actual execution time and resource consumption, leading to cost savings for applications with varying workloads.

Stateless Execution: Serverless functions are designed to be stateless, with external storage services used for maintaining necessary state or data.

Rapid Deployment and Scaling: Serverless functions can be deployed quickly and scale instantly to handle high concurrency or traffic spikes.

In summary, serverless computing provides a hassle-free server management experience, enables efficient resource utilization, offers automatic scaling, introduces cost-effective billing, and facilitates rapid deployment and scaling of functions.

## Serverless computing differs from traditional server-based architectures in several key ways. In serverless computing:

Developers are relieved from server management tasks, as the cloud provider handles infrastructure provisioning, scaling, and maintenance.

Resources are allocated dynamically based on actual demand, ensuring efficient resource utilization and eliminating the need for manual scaling.

Billing follows a pay-per-use model, where you are charged only for the actual execution time and resources consumed by your functions, potentially resulting in cost savings.

Automatic scaling is a core feature of serverless platforms, enabling applications to scale seamlessly without manual intervention.

Serverless computing promotes a modular development approach, where applications are composed of smaller, independent functions that can be developed, deployed, and scaled individually.

Customize your deployment settings, such as custom domains or environment variables.

Collaborate and iterate on your project using Vercel's collaboration features.
## 3. What are APIs, and how can they be utilized in Python applications to access and manipulate data from external sources?
APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are sets of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. In Python applications, APIs can be used to access and manipulate data from external sources. This is achieved by sending HTTP requests to API endpoints, receiving and parsing the API responses, handling authentication and authorization, manipulating the data, and handling errors and rate limiting. Python libraries and tools provide support for working with APIs, making it easy to integrate external services and access the desired data. By utilizing APIs, Python applications can leverage the functionality and data offered by external services, enabling seamless integration and automation.
## 4. What is the Requests library in Python, and how can it be used to interact with APIs by sending HTTP requests? Can you provide an example of a basic GET request using the Requests library?
The Requests library in Python is a popular third-party library that simplifies the process of sending HTTP requests and handling the corresponding responses. It provides an intuitive and easy-to-use interface for interacting with APIs and other web services.

        command uses:
         pip install requests

The Requests library in Python simplifies the process of interacting with APIs by allowing developers to send HTTP requests and handle the corresponding responses. By importing the library and using the `get()` function, developers can send a GET request to the API endpoint and retrieve the response. Checking the status code ensures the success of the request, and accessing the response content using the `json()` method allows for further processing and utilization of the data. Error handling can be implemented for unsuccessful requests. The Requests library provides additional features for customizing requests, such as adding headers, passing parameters, and handling authentication, offering flexibility in API integration.
